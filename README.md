# Enes Zeytin — DevOps Engineer ⚙️

I build, automate, and operate **cloud-native systems** with a focus on **CI/CD reliability**, **container orchestration**, and **observability**.

Currently working as a **DevOps Engineer at YegCloud**, contributing to **IBM ACE enterprise integration projects** by managing and improving **CI pipelines on Azure DevOps**.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build and maintain **CI/CD pipelines** for enterprise-grade integration systems  
- Automate build, test, and deployment workflows on **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions**  
- Support **containerized workloads** running on Kubernetes  
- Improve system **observability** using metrics and dashboards  
- Work closely with developers to reduce friction between code and production

## 🧠 How I Think About DevOps

DevOps, for me, is about **reducing uncertainty** between development and production.  
I value **simple pipelines**, **explicit trade-offs**, and systems that are easy to observe, operate, and evolve — not clever but fragile setups.
