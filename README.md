## How I Approach DevOps

I see DevOps as a practice of **reducing uncertainty** between development and production.

I value clear pipelines, explicit trade-offs, and systems that are easy to understand and operate.  
Beyond tooling, I care about **knowledge sharing and team alignment** — documenting workflows, sharing lessons learned, and helping teams build confidence in the systems they run.
