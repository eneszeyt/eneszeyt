## How I Approach DevOps

I see DevOps as a practice of reducing uncertainty between development and production.

I value clear pipelines, explicit trade-offs, and systems that are easy to understand and operate.  
I also actively support **knowledge sharing within teams** by documenting workflows, sharing operational insights, and helping others build confidence in the systems they run.
